One often masters a science but forgets to appreciate how a theory of today has travelled through times and developed due to contributions from great minds across all time periods. What I discuss ahead is how Astronomy took the form it has today: a historical account of the science of celestial objects. Can we argue that Astronomy was the first observational science? To cover the subject in mere three pages is highly unfair to the vastness of the subject. With due apologies, I shall try to touch upon most of the aspects
