### 1. Astro Instruments 101

*Abstract:* The project covers the basics and applications of astronomical instrumentation, involving all four components of it: namely, Optics, Modelling (CAD Designing), Electronics (Sensors, Detectors and Transducers) and Computer Interfacing (Data acquisition and digital input-output via LabVIEW). Celestial motion and orbital dynamics will also be covered for an in-depth knowledge about the instrument's working. We will also look into the historical emergence of Astro instruments and how they evolved and developed with time, and what is to come next by undertaking detailed studies of the Hubble and James Webb Space Telescope and also learn about their subsystems.

*Expected Workload*: 6 hr/week

*Mentors:* Atharva Dehadraya, Mubashshir Uddin, Yashika Malhotra

*Resources:* <a href="/assets/docs/projects/2022/Astro_101/Handbook.pdf" target="_blank">Handbook</a>, <a href="/assets/docs/projects/2022/Astro_101/Poster.pdf" target="_blank">Poster</a>

### 2. Blast Off!

*Abstract:* The project aims to study the fundamentals of Rocketry and to appreciate the engineering that goes into building rockets for successful space programs. We shall begin by understanding the foundations of rocket design and propulsion systems. Then moving on with orbital dynamics of objects launched in space. We will also look into optimising rockets for the maximum payload to cost ratio through multi-objective genetic algorithms. Towards the end of the project, we would focus on building and launching a model rocket, a first for IIT Kanpur.

*Expected Workload*: 8 hr/week

*Mentors:* Adit Jain, Shashank Sinha, Vasu Paliwal

### 3. XUVI

*Abstract:* Astronomical solar flare data is extremely noisy and needs proper filtering and noise reduction. During the project, we shall look into the applications of different computing libraries of python, in reading and analysing different datasets. Astronomical Spectroscopy, Exoplanets, Light Curves would be theoretical foundations for giving rise to the importance of python implementation in astronomy. The aim would be to implement computational techniques in observing and plotting data, pre processing of the data, applying spectrum analysis, and then moving on to developing our own algorithm for modelling the flares as a concluding remark. A very interesting part of the project would be crafting a basic model of spectroscope which would provide the analysis of the spectrum of sunlight at different times of the day.

*Expected Workload*: 6 hr/week
