*Github Repository Link:*  [astroclubiitk/Tour de OAAR](https://github.com/astroclubiitk/Tour-de-OAAR-2023)

*Resources:* <a href="/assets/docs/projects/2023/Tour_de_OAAR/Handbook.pdf" target="_blank">Handbook</a>, <a href="/assets/docs/projects/2023/Tour_de_OAAR/Poster.pdf" target="_blank">Poster</a>

### 2. Optical Odyssey

*Abstract:* 

*Expected Workload*: 6 hr/week

*Mentors:* Anushree Shukla, Princy Chauhan, Shreya Rajak

*Github Repository Link:*  [astroclubiitk/Optical Odysssey](https://github.com/astroclubiitk/Optical-Odyssey-2023)

*Resources:* <a href="/assets/docs/projects/2023/Optical_Odyssey/Handbook.pdf" target="_blank">Handbook</a>, <a href="/assets/docs/projects/2023/Optical_Odyssey/Poster.pdf" target="_blank">Poster</a>

### 3. CosmoCode

*Abstract:* This project demonstrates how Observational Astronomy and Computational Astronomy go hand in hand. You will observe the space using the Horn Antennas that you are going to construct in Space Science and Astronomy Lab. You will then process the obtained data using Signal Processing Techniques and you will also use ML models to help us along the journey.

*Expected Workload*: 6 hr/week

*Mentors:* Arpit Anand, Shrilakshmi S K, Suryansh Gaur

*Github Repository Link:*  [astroclubiitk/CosmoCode](https://github.com/astroclubiitk/CosmoCode-2023)

*Resources:* <a href="/assets/docs/projects/2023/CosmoCode/Handbook.pdf" target="_blank">Handbook</a>, <a href="/assets/docs/projects/2023/CosmoCode/Poster.pdf" target="_blank">Poster</a>

### 4. Stellar Odyssey

*Abstract:* This project mainly focuses on the Astrophysics aspect of Science, contrary to the other projects
offered by the club during Summers 2023, which are computational and based on hands-on experience. This project aims to
ensure that students get enthusiastic in the field of Astronomy by applying concepts of Physics and
understanding and analyzing raw data of official resources like NASA and ISRO and
understanding the fate of stars through this Summer project. This project will also include the
usage of the Observatory located in the Flight Laboratory to give the students an experience of
locating star structures and learning Image processing as a collab with the other summer
projects offered by the club. The project's theme is the life cycle of a star and its entire fate,
considering various classifications. This project mainly expects students who are deeply
interested in Science and want to pursue research in the future. They will definitely have
exposure to research, meeting deadlines, interacting with mentors and mentees by discussing
Science of the Universe, and actually applying them (using the Observatory).

*Expected Workload*: 6 hr/week
