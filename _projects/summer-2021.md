### 1. Computational Astrophysics

_Abstract:_ Today a major chunk of astronomical research involves analyzing huge datasets as well as simulating astrophysical processes and thus, computational methods come in handy to an astronomer. The project aims to build a foundation for computational astrophysics. We shall study basic tools such as Astropy and move on to its implementation in time domain astronomy, image processing, spectral analysis among others. The last weeks shall be devoted to applying the techniques to analyze an astrophysical phenomenon or object(s).

_Expected Workload:_ 6 hr/week

_Mentors:_ Gurbaaz Singh Nandra, Mohammad Saad, Varun Muralidharan

### 2. Space: The Final Frontier

_Abstract:_ The project aims to study the fundamentals of designing a space mission and to acknowledge the efforts made by space research organisations in designing and executing successful space programs. We shall understand the foundations of rocket design and propulsion systems along with the dynamics and systems which keep things that we sent to space, in space. Eventually, we shall look at the future of interstellar travel and what we must achieve before our goal becomes a reality.

_Expected Workload:_ 6 hr/week

_Mentors:_ Mubashshir Uddin, Sunny Kumar Bhagat, Varun Singh

### 3. RAD

_Abstract:_ To understand the Universe and its intricacies, it is essential to do a proper study of the different astrophysical objects and related phenomena. The project aims to do the same from a theoretical astrophysics perspective. We shall try to understand basic astronomy such as how locations and distances are measured on the cosmic scale and then see how Newton’s two body problem produces the path of the gigantic binary stars. The project will also take a tour around stellar structure and galaxies, their types and formation. Towards the end, we shall see how it all began, that is, the Universe’s birth.

_Expected Workload:_ 4 hr/week

_Mentors:_ Mubashshir Uddin, Mohammad Saad, Varun Muralidharan
